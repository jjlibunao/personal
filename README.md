# Welcome to my repository!
Joren Libunao

This is my personal repository for projects I worked on during my time as a USF MSDS student that were allowed to be published or just projects I worked on in my own spare time. Please feel free to ask me about other projects I worked on in the program that were not allowed to be published, as I have many more that I would like to share, but due to plagiarism concerns for future cohorts I am not allowed to share them here. I would be happy to share sample code in those instances upon request.
